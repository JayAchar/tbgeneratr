Generate variables from cleaned MSF TB programme data

## Introduction

The R package `tbgeneratr` was developed to be used in synergy with `tbcleanr` to simplify cleaning and processing for routinely collected TB programme data. `tbgeneratr` compliments `tbcleanr` output data frames by processing and generating more complex data points, such as individual patient culture conversion dates. Following development of `tbreportr`, a simplified workflow from raw data to automated reporting will be realised through `tbcleanr`, `tbgeneratr` and `tbreportr`. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of tbcleanr from [Github](http://www.github.com/JayAchar) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(devtools)
install_github("JayAchar/tbgeneratr")
library(tbgeneratr)
```

## Important functions

Function               | Use it for
--------------         | ------------------------------------------
`adm_generator()`      | Calculate age and BMI variables, and split start treatment date to allow easier analysis
`adm_lab_generator()`  | Calculate baseline smear and culture status, conversion dates, and baseline drug susceptbility results
