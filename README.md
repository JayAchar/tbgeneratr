Generate variables from cleaned MSF TB programme data

Introduction
------------

The R package `tbgeneratr` was developed to be used in synergy with `tbcleanr` to simplify cleaning and processing for routinely collected TB programme data. `tbgeneratr` compliments `tbcleanr` output data frames by processing and generating more complex data points, such as individual patient culture conversion dates. Following development of `tbreportr`, a simplified workflow from raw data to automated reporting will be realised through `tbcleanr`, `tbgeneratr` and `tbreportr`.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of `tbgeneratr` from [Github](http://www.github.com/JayAchar) with:

``` r
require(devtools)
install_github("JayAchar/tbgeneratr")
library(tbgeneratr)
```
